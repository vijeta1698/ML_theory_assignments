    "Classical conditioning is a learning process in which an association is made between a previously neutral stimulus and a stimulus that naturally evokes a response.\n",
    "\n",

    "<b>Observational Learning</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Observational learning is a process in which learning occurs through observing and imitating others. Albert Bandura's social learning theory suggests that in addition to learning through conditioning, people also learn through observing and imitating the actions of others.\n",
    "As demonstrated in his classic \"Bobo Doll\" experiments, people will imitate the actions of others without direct reinforcement. Four important elements are essential for effective observational learning: attention, motor skills, motivation, and memory. \n",
    "<b> Operant Conditioning</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Operant conditioning is a learning process in which the probability of a response occurring is increased or decreased due to reinforcement or punishment. First studied by Edward Thorndike and later by B.F. Skinner, the underlying idea behind operant conditioning is that the consequences of our actions shape voluntary behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skinner described how reinforcement could lead to increases in behaviors where punishment would result in decreases. He also found that the timing of when reinforcements were delivered influenced how quickly a behavior was learned and how strong the response would be. The timing and rate of reinforcement are known as schedules of reinforcement. \n",

    "Generalization is a term used to describe a model’s ability to react to new data. That is, after being trained on a training set, a model can digest new data and make accurate predictions. A model’s ability to generalize is central to the success of a model. If a model has been trained too well on training data, it will be unable to generalize. It will make inaccurate predictions when given new data, making the model useless even though it is able to make accurate predictions for the training data. This is called overfitting. The inverse is also true. Underfitting happens when a model has not been trained enough on the data. In the case of underfitting, it makes the model just as useless and it is not capable of making accurate predictions, even with the training data.\n",

Training a generalized machine learning model means, in general, it works for all subset of unseen data. An example is when we train a model to classify between dogs and cats. If the model is provided with dogs images dataset with only two breeds, it may obtain a good performance. But, it possibly gets a low classification score when it is tested by other breeds of dogs as well. This issue can result to classify an actual dog image as a cat from the unseen dataset. Therefore, data diversity is very important factor in order to make a good prediction. In the sample above, the model may obtain 85% performance score when it is tested by only two dog breeds and gains 70% if trained by all breeds. However, the first possibly gets a very low score (e.g. 45%) if it is evaluated by an unseen dataset with all breed dogs. This for the latter can be unchanged given than it has been trained by high data diversity including all possible breeds.\n",

Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. Examples of Supervised Learning: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.\n",

    "The best way to understand linear regression is to relive this experience of childhood. Let us say, you ask a child in fifth grade to arrange people in his class by increasing order of weight, without asking them their weights! What do you think the child will do? He / she would likely look (visually analyze) at the height and build of people and arrange them using a combination of these visible parameters. This is linear regression in real life! The child has actually figured out that height and build would be correlated to the weight by a relationship, which looks like the equation above.\n",

In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).\n",

The outcome to this study would be something like this – if you are given a trignometry based tenth grade problem, you are 70% likely to solve it. On the other hand, if it is grade fifth history question, the probability of getting an answer is only 30%. This is what Logistic Regression provides you.\n",

    "The “reinforcement” in reinforcement learning refers to how certain behaviors are encouraged, and others discouraged. Behaviors are reinforced through rewards which are gained through experiences with the environment.\n",
    "Modern reinforcement learning is built upon two main threads. One thread concerns learning by trial and error and originated in the psychology of animal learning. The second thread concerns the problem of optimal control, and it is a solution using value functions and dynamic programming ( Sutton and Barto., 2018). Reinforcement learning borrowed his name from the first thread of studies. According to Watkins (1989), in studying the animals' ability to learn, the animals may be automatically provided with reinforcers. In behavioral terms, a positive reinforcer might be a morsel of food for a hungry animal, for instance, or a sip of water for a thirsty animal. Conversely, a negative reinforcer might be an electric shock."

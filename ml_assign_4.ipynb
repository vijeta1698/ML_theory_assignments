    "<b>Step 1: Collect Data</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the problem you want to solve, you will have to investigate and obtain data that you will use to feed your machine. The quality and quantity of information you get are very important since it will directly impact how well or badly your model will work. You may have the information in an existing database or you must create it from scratch. If it is a small project you can create a spreadsheet that will later be easily exported as a CSV file. It is also common to use the web scraping technique to automatically collect information from various sources such as APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 2: Prepare the data</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good time to visualize your data and check if there are correlations between the different characteristics that we obtained. It will be necessary to make a selection of characteristics since the ones you choose will directly impact the execution times and the results. You can also reduce dimensions by applying PCA if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you must balance the amount of data we have for each result -class- so that it is significant as the learning may be biased towards a type of response and when your model tries to generalize knowledge it will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also separate the data into two groups: one for training and the other for model evaluation which can be divided approximately in a ratio of 80/20 but it can vary depending on the case and the volume of data we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, you can also pre-process your data by normalizing, eliminating duplicates, and making error corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 3: Choose the model</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several models that you can choose according to the objective that you might have: you will use algorithms of classification, prediction, linear regression, clustering, i.e. k-means or K-Nearest Neighbor, Deep Learning, i.e Neural Networks, Bayesian, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various models to be used depending on the data you are going to process such as images, sound, text, and numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 4 Train your machine model</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to train the datasets to run smoothly and see an incremental improvement in the prediction rate. Remember to initialize the weights of your model randomly -the weights are the values that multiply or affect the relationships between the inputs and outputs- which will be automatically adjusted by the selected algorithm the more you train them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 5: Evaluation</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "you will have to check the machine created against your evaluation data set that contains inputs that the model does not know and verify the precision of your already trained model. If the accuracy is less than or equal to 50%, that model will not be useful since it would be like tossing a coin to make decisions. If you reach 90% or more, you can have good confidence in the results that the model gives you.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 6: Parameter Tuning</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "If during the evaluation you did not obtain good predictions and your precision is not the minimum desired, it is possible that you have overfitting -or underfitting problems and you must return to the training step before making a new configuration of parameters in your model. You can increase the number of times you iterate your training data- termed epochs. Another important parameter is the one known as the “learning rate”, which is usually a value that multiplies the gradient to gradually bring it closer to the global -or local- minimum to minimize the cost of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing your values by 0.1 units from 0.001 is not the same as this can significantly affects the model execution time. You can also indicate the maximum error allowed for your model. You can go from taking a few minutes to hours, and even days, to train your machine. These parameters are often called Hyperparameters. This “tuning” is still more of an art than a science and will improve as you experiment. There are usually many parameters to adjust and when combined they can trigger all your options. Each algorithm has its own parameters to adjust. To name a few more, in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) you must define in its architecture the number of hidden layers it will have and gradually test with more or less and with how many neurons each layer. This will be a work of great effort and patience to give good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 7: Prediction or Inference</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to use your Machine Learning model inferring results in real-life scenarios."

   "source": [
    "<b>Numerical Data</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data. This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
    "Numerical data can be characterized by continuous or discrete data. Continuous data can assume any value within a range whereas discrete data has distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the number of students taking Python class would be a discrete data set. You can only have discrete whole number values like 10, 25, or 33. A class cannot have 12.75 students enrolled. A student either join a class or he doesn’t. On the other hand, continuous data are numbers that can fall anywhere within a range. Like a student could have an average score of 88.25 which falls between 0 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Categorical Data</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown. Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",
    "In the context of super classification, categorical data would be the class label. This would also be something like if a person is a man or woman, or property is residential or commercial.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also something called ordinal data, which in some sense is a mix of numerical and categorical data. In ordinal data, the data still falls into categories, but those categories are ordered or ranked in some particular way. An example would be class difficulty, such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Those three types of classes would be a way that we could label the classes, and they have a natural order in increasing difficulty.\n",
    "Another example is that we just take quantitative data, and splitting it into groups, so we have bins or categories of other types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Time Series Data</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. It is very important, especially in particular fields like finance. Time series data has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might measure the average number of home sales for many years. The difference of time series data and numerical data is that rather than having a bunch of numerical values that don’t have any time ordering, time-series data does have some implied ordering. There is a first data point collected and the last data point collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Text</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data is basically just words. A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it into numbers using some interesting functions like the bag of words formulation."

That in turn can work quite well or not for your classification algorithm.\n"

    "Data exploration, also known as exploratory data analysis (EDA), is a process where users look at and understand their data with statistical and visualization methods. This step helps identifying patterns and problems in the dataset, as well as deciding which model or algorithm to use in subsequent steps.\n",
    "Although sometimes researchers tend to spend more time on model architecture design and parameter tuning, the importance of data exploration should not be ignored. For example, imagine you have developed a perfect model. However, if your data breaks the assumption of your model or your data contains errors, you will not be able to get the desired results from your perfect model. Without data exploration, you may even spend most of your time checking your model without realizing the problem in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example where your model can deliver unexpected results if the dataset is not carefully examined. Amazon once created an AI hiring tool to screen resumes (Dastin, 2018). They used the past 10 years of Amazon applicants’ resumes to train the model. However, the recommendation of the model biased heavily towards men and even penalized resumes that included words related to “women”, such as “women’s chess club captain”. The reason for such bias is due to the unbalanced number of male and female applicants in the past 10 years, as shown in Figure 3. In fact, if the data exploration step was properly performed, it would be easy to uncover such imbalance by looking at the distribution of genders.\n",

    "Quantitative analysis is often associated with numerical analysis where data is collected, classified, and then computed for certain findings using a set of statistical methods. Data is chosen randomly in large samples and then analyzed. The advantage of quantitative analysis the findings can be applied in a general population using research patterns developed in the sample. This is a shortcoming of qualitative data analysis because of limited generalization of findings.\n",
    "\n",
    " Quantitative analysis is more objective in nature. It seeks to understand the occurrence of events and then describe them using statistical methods. However, more clarity can be obtained by concurrently using qualitative and quantitative methods. Quantitative analysis normally leaves the random and scarce events in research results whereas qualitative analysis considers them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative analysis is generally concerned with measurable quantities such as weight, length, temperature, speed, width, and many more. The data can be expressed in a tabular form or any diagrammatic representation using graphs or charts. Quantitative data can be classified as continuous or discrete, and it is often obtained using surveys, observations, experiments or interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, limitations in quantitative analysis. For instance, it can be challenging to uncover relatively new concepts using quantitative analysis and that is where qualitative analysis comes into the equation to find out “why” a certain phenomenon occurs. That is why the methods are often used simultaneously.\n"
